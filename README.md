# Word Counter
This program relizes a simple word counter using Python. The program counts predefined words and returns a graph containing the mean and absolute number the word was found in one or multiple PDF files. It was implemented for application in a seminar paper by Nico Schurig from the [TU Bergakademie Freiberg](https://tu-freiberg.de). The seminar paper focuses on robotic applications for surgery.
Although this program was made for a very specific usecase it also can be used for other scenarios.
## How To Use
- At first generate a new .txt file (this will contain your the words you want to search for).
- After that, write the words into the .txt file.
